I will try to explain in very simple explanation so that it will be useful for beginners.</p><a id="more"></a><h3 id="Why-JavaScript"><a href="#Why-JavaScript" class="headerlink" title="Why JavaScript ?"></a>Why JavaScript ?</h3><p>In the past years JavaScript was only used to support server side programming languages such as PHP, Python, etc. But only as a client side.</p><p>However, since Ryan Dahl created NodeJS, JavaScript can be used as a server side language. This is a big thing and I’m sure JavaScript will be the future in the programming world. Proven since 2010, JavaScript has always been the most popular language to learn.</p><p>So it’s not too late if you want to start learning JavaScript from now on. Hexoder will try to provide a very simple explanation for you.</p><p>So make sure you bookmark this Hexoder website and get article updates every week.</p><p>Thank you</p>]]></content>
